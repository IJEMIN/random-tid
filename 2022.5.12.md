- You can run C# Job on SystemBase type from Entity Component System package by Unity.
    - Some random guy from internet insist you *must* take care about job only on ECS than MonoBehaviour instance.
    - I don't think so. Reserving new job from main thread is not evil. Anyway it's better than any other non parallel processing codes.
- If u talk shit about goverment with friend while u walk down street, Russian "officers" may take your iPhone, ask your pin number.
- They may beat your ass even in airpot or airplane.
