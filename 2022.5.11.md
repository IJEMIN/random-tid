# 2022.5.11

- Unity Addressable China package didn't support caching for ecrypted asset bundle when we caalled  ```DownloadDependecies()``` method.
    - so when raw webrequest for encrypted asset bundle which created from BeginOperation ends, we manually create copy stream, put data to encrypted asset bundle cache path

- diffrent addressable group InternalId won't prevent using previously builted asset bundle. I thought they checked internalId, but it looks like they use file name hash for comparing previous builted asset bundle.
